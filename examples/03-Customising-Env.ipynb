    "For more complex systems (and therefore simulink models) the definition of other action and observation spaces are very useful tools. Also, there can be inputs which are external but not controlled by the agent. In the following example this will be shown for an example from the area of energy systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "As example, the energy managenment of a DC microgrid is chosen. The microgrid consist of a PV array, a battery storage, a load and a grid connection. The corresponding simulink file (MicrogridExample.slx) and the necessary simscape-files (shortCircuit.ssc, VariablePowerLoad.ssc and Wire_2Cond.ssc) are included. The control/optimisation task for a RL agent will be described in detail in the next examples. The main idea is to optimise the use of the battery storage to minimise the energy consuption from the main grid and maximise the use of the PV energy.\n",

    "A look at the input list shows that only some of them shall be controlled by the agent while others depend on environmental parameters like the actual weather or are fixed system parameters. In this example, only the voltage references for grid and battery converters are to be controlled. For irradiance and module temperature for the PV module model real data from an external source is imported. The values for the initial SOC at the start of a training episode are randomised to cover many possible scenarios. For the reference voltages, only discrete steps shall be possible, so two discrete actions with 11 possible states each are defined in the action space. During the action assignment, they are converted into reference steps between -0.4 and 0.4 V.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, 13 outputs are a lot and not necessary for the agent since some of them contain similiar information. Knowledge about the voltages and source currents as well as the battery SOC is enough. This results in 8 observations which are continous, but can only take limited values wich will be normalised to values between +-1 in the ovbservation processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the spaces needs to modified. For this, a new class is defined which is inherited from the StableRLS base class and the corresponding setter methods are overriden. In addition to the setter methods, the methods for assignment of the actions and the observation processing are overridden."
